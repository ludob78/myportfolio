  "about_me": "After graduating with a degree in Accounting, I decided to pursue my passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned full-stack web development. My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB bas on JS/TS. I am always looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a full-time position as a software developer. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games with my daughter, reading tech books, watching movies/series. I also enjoy learning new things. I am currently learning about history and philosophy. I'm also learning how to play the guitar.",
